# Level up your PM'ing

Do you want to reach the next level in your PM career? Are you not sure what to do to get there? Do you want to learn best practices from Silicon Valley PM's?

**Take charge of your career and become a great product leader.**

With 15 years experience as a PM at startups and big tech companies, I've been lucky to learn from generous senior PM's. Now I'd like to do the same for you.

> Understanding my strengths and weaknesses, and asking colleagues to take ownership of certain areas has really helped me laser focus on my core competencies. This showed near immediate results in time saved and mental load decreased.
