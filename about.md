# Hi, I'm Brad!

I'm a Product Manager from Santa Cruz who loves üé∂ [synthwave](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1sjamnHIeKEKqkYVwFtXo9?si=fKVR4sAQQpilJ8v0hRf7Ug) music 
 and üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [surfing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCua3mzcLcg).

I started this site to share the knowledge I've gained in 15 years spent PM'ing. I've founded startups, worked at tech companies large and small, and even worked as a professional gamer and DJ along the way.

My current clients tell me that I can quickly cut through their ambiguous questions and bring a structured framework and advice that blends head and heart.
