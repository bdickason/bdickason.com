# Tools are a distraction

I switched newsletter platforms before I ever sent out a single newsletter. I had a form on my website, a list of emails, and my first newsletter ready to go. Instead, I spent two weeks migrating to a new tool before firing off my first email.

In college, I spent 50 hours researching guitars. When I finally purchased one, I played it less than ten times.

I spent years trying to find the perfect surfboard, only to settle on the second board I ever purchased.

**You spend time researching and buying tools because you believe they'll fulfill a fantasy.** You want to go faster, become more productive, or get better at what you do. 

You think that a new guitar will help you play like Eddie Van Halen or a new pair of shoes will make you jump as high as Michael Jordan. This is just clever marketing.

Reebok sold [the Pump](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28149048/inside-rise-fall-iconic-reebok-pump-30th-birthday), Nike the [Air Jordan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrTHJeqZA2o#t=6s). Each of them came with a flashy marketing campaign and commercials featuring the best athletes in the world soaring towards the basket. When you first bring them home, you feel a rush. But that feeling quickly dissipates.

Shoes [don't make you jump higher](https://liveforbball.com/do-basketball-shoes-make-you-jump-higher). They just give you a false sense of accomplishment.

Meanwhile, experts can succeed with the most basic tools.

Kelly Slater can [catch a wave on a dining room table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhAP2R8o8lk). JOB can [ride a Costco Wavestorm (the defacto beginner board) at Pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D5ugxEVBXA), one of the most challenging waves on the planet.

The amount of time saved rarely comes close to the time spent learning a new tool. It's easier to look for a new tool than to do the work. It's easier to blame the tool than yourself.

You don't need another tool. You don't need a different productivity app.

You just need to put in the time.
