# Take a break

You are constantly busy. You are constantly working or launching a side project or polishing a hobby.

Your brain and bodiy weren't designed to run at 100% uptime.

The number one piece of advice I give people is to <strong>work less</strong>. 

There will always be more work. There won't always be more time.

I'm on vacation with my family in Palm Springs. See you all next week ðŸ˜Ž
