# Write Things Down

The trends:

1. Workplace communication is moving online. 
2. Online communication is moving to chat. 
3. **As a result, Information is lost.**


These are real examples from friends:
* You join a new team, you want to ramp up and get context on the past two years. You are told: *"Welome, scroll up and read chat history until 2018."* üò©
* You're trying to understand why an important decision was made. You are told: *"I think we talked about that around the first week of January."* üßê
* You find out about an important discussion from a coworker. *"Oh that happened in this meeting, we forgot to add you. Sorry!"* üò§

**Chat/Meetings are great for ephemeral topics but fails at building institutional knowledge. Meetings share the same problem.**

You can solve these shortcomings by writing things down and generating an artifact that outlives your chat conversations or meetings.

## Benefits of writing things down
* Can be consumed asynchronously at any time.
* Can be edited or updated at any time.
* Forces you to think through the topic and be explicit and clear.
* Can be written collaboratively.

## Downsides of writing things down
* It takes time to write.
* If not maintained, documents can grow stale.

There is a cost to writing, but the benefits to your team are huge. You'll see better collaboration, fewer re-opened decisions, and an overall decrease in meetings/chat volume.

There's a reason that industry experts such as [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) or [Andrew Chen](https://andrewchen.co/) have been able to grow large audiences with their writing. It lives on beyond any conversation, e-mail thread, or presentation/pitch.

You can have the same effect on your team/company.

## How to make this change on your team

**1. Start writing (Now!)**

It sounds simple, but the first step is to start writing. You need to set the example and start generating artifacts that others can refers to. This can start as a lightweight set of meeting notes or a strategy document. The important thing is that you start showing people the value of writing.

An easy and lightweight way to get this started is to link to a google doc for meeting notes instead of sharing takeaways via e-mail or chat. Google Docs is great because everyone already has an account and it allows collaborative editing/commenting.

You'll know this is working when someone else shares a link to something they wrote.

**2. A place to store / discover / share things written down**

Now that you've started writing, you'll need a place to start storing your documents (and other peoples' documents) as you'll quickly get overwhelmed.

Store/Discover: Good places to start are Shared Folders (e.g. one folder per team), an index document w/ links, or a wiki. Always start lightweight and only expand when it gets untenable. 

The biggest challenge with these systems is maintaining them over time so make sure you (or someone on your team) regularly checks in and prunes or reorganizes them. Again, this takes time but is worth it for organic discovery of documents by your team.

Share: Figure out where people already communicate today and use existing channels. For example, link agenda docs to a calendar invite, link meeting notes in a summary e-mail, and link discussion notes in chat.

**3. Building the habit of writing**

Once you've done the ground work, you'll need to keep writing and encouraging others to do so. The best way to do this is to set an example and then reward others who exhibit the same behavior. See a link shared in chat? Comment the heck out of that document. See a link shared via e-mail, make sure you respond with positive feedback.

**Note: I'm following this same process for this post :) My first step was to start writing my thoughts down.**
