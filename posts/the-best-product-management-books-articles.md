# The Best Product Management books, articles, and videos

Iâ€™ve kept mental notes of the resources that changed the way I look at Product Management over the past 15 years. Typically after reading, I would share one of these with every PM I know and not stop talking about them for weeks. This week I went back and tracked down all of them and wrote a one line review. 

**Iâ€™m sure I missed a few, but this is a highly curated, fairly exhaustive set of articles that resonated strongly with me and shaped me into the PM I am today (plus a few recent ones to stay relevant :D).**

**My criteria:**

1. Insightful - Shares a new idea or frames it in an incredibly clear way
2. Evergreen - not related to a specific trend or moment in time
3. Accessible - you can jump right in without knowing a bunch of jargon

## The books that shaped my PM worldview

* **[Steve Krug - Donâ€™t Make Me Think](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789723107/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0789723107&linkCode=as2&tag=bdickason-20&linkId=2d2cd202a9a369757dd7f82e9cc29fcd) by Steve Krug (2000)**
    * **One Line Review: Practical usability tips rooted in real examples.**
    * Most of the beautiful visual design you throw at a product tends to confuse people.
    * Make it obvious is a better mantra than â€˜fewer stepsâ€™ or â€˜less clicksâ€™ which sometimes make things NOT obvious.
    * Every tiny decision adds to our cognitive workload and ultimately causes users to quit.
    * Show your designs to real users before shipping them.
* **[The Unix Philosophy](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/ch01s06.html) by Ken Thompson (1978)**
    * **One Line Review: A set of principles to build focused software that doesnâ€™t sprawl.**
    * Write programs that do one thing and do one thing well.
    * Expect the output of every program to become the input of another.
    * Design software (even operating systems) to be tried early, ideally within weeks.
    * Use tools (vs manual processes) to lighten a task.
* **[Jane Jacobs - Death and Life of Great American Cities](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067974195X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=067974195X&linkCode=as2&tag=bdickason-20&linkId=d25c277c0dec4614ca7fbc5cd6e67af2) by Jane Jacobs (1961)**
    * **One Line Review: The design of cities have a dramatic effects on human behavior (much like software).**
    * Poorer neighborhoods are safer because the community (e.g. grandma looking out the window to watch kids, merchant standing outside his shop) are invested in its safety.
    * Well placed parks can make a neighborhood feel alive. Poorly placed parks can be the epicenter of crime.
    * The broken window theory - A broken window on a street noone ever walks down will stay open indefinitely.
    * â€˜Ideal citiesâ€™ do not exist. Every time we try to build an ideal city, humans suffer. Great cities sprawl.
* **[Influence - The Psychology of Persuasion](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067974195X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=067974195X&linkCode=as2&tag=bdickason-20&linkId=d25c277c0dec4614ca7fbc5cd6e67af2) by Robert Cialdini (1984)**
    * **One Line Review: Tangible examples of how humans behave irrationally.**
    * You can use versions of these techniques when building products or when working with other people.
    * I donâ€™t look at these as tricks but rather ways to more deeply understand humans and understand why we behave the way we do.
    * Most of the situations apply to everyday PM Leadership & Drive situations, such as:
        * Itâ€™s easier to make a sale if you start with a foot in the door.
        * If someone buys you lunch, you feel obligated to it for them.
        * If you see a tip jar with money in it, youâ€™re more likely to donate.
