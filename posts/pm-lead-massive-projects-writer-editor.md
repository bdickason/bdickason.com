# How top silicon valley PM's lead massive projects

**Hint: they don’t do it by themselves.** 

They don’t work longer hours or ‘hustle more.’

They delegate work to others and review it regularly.

**They are editors, not writers.**

You can do the same.

**Editors start with the outcome.** They identify the decision(s) needed and the artifacts (e.g. a pitch deck, a strategy doc, or a plan) to get there. This allows them to work backwards and identify all of the pieces needed to get to that desired end state.

**Editors break artifacts down into chunks**. They create an outline for each artifact and break it into mutually exclusive pieces that can be worked on independently. This allows the work to be parallelized by multiple people.

**Editors make someone accountable for every piece**. They identify the person who is best suited to complete each piece of work. They write that person’s name next to a section and ask them to own it. *We’ll call these people the writers.* This allows the editor to fully delegate large chunks of the project. The editor should only write pieces they are uniquely suited for.

**Editors lay out milestones**. They identify a reasonable (but aggressive) set of timelines and deliverables to complete the work. They propose these timelines and let writers push back. This creates a predictable schedule.

**Editors review work on a regular cadence.** They set a schedule (typically weekly) to go over all work leading up to a milestone. This ensures that work is on track and prevents a ‘grand reveal’ just before a milestone.

**Editors hold writers to high standards**. They ask questions and critique until the work is as good as their own. Ideally it’s even better. 
> *“Good editors are not ‘permissive’; they do not let their colleagues do ‘their thing’; they make sure that everybody does the ‘[product’s] thing.’”* -Peter Drucker

**Editors take over writing if the work isn’t converging.** They monitor progress and give feedback if projects are behind. They will take control if work isn’t coming in on time or at quality. They only do this as a last resort (as it jeopardizes autonomy/trust).

**Editors stay high level.** They constantly remind writers of goals and problems. This allows writers to go deep into the details but ensures someone has the big picture in their head.

Bonus addition: There’s one additional mode that I employ from time to time. I’ll call it ‘the janitor.’ The janitor plugs every hole on a team, from taking notes to pulling SQL queries to QA’ing releases. This mode is useful when you have an understaffed team or want to deeply understand a problem space.

**What do you do to get into creative mode? Do you have a system or tips? I'd love to hear more: [@bdickason](http://twitter.com/bdickason)**
